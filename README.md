# Natural Disaster Damage Image Classification
## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Natural disasters are events we hope to avoid, yet when they occur, rapid intervention and damage assessment become critical. Manually classifying disaster images can be tedious and time-consuming, especially with large datasets. <br/>
This project addresses that by automating the classification of natural disaster images using deep learning. Leveraging a ResNet50-based model, the system enhances situational awareness and post-disaster damage assessments by identifying disasters such as Flood, Sinkhole, Earthquake, and Forest Fire with over 98% accuracy. This contributes to faster disaster response and aligns with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) like: <br/>
- SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
- SDG 13: Climate Action

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Dataset loaded using ImageFolder
- Class-wise sample display and count
- Split: 80% Training | 20% Validation
- Normalization using computed mean and standard deviation
- Data Augmentation (training only): Resize, Flip, Rotate
- Validation set: Only normalized
